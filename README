See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_File_Binary_Format for a full
description of this file format.

I wanted a way to dump some malware without opening it, so I needed a parser
and dumper for this format.

TODO
- only dumps down to the raw directory
-- display the dir in a human readable way
-- optionally extract the contents of some of the streams
   (note: quick tests showed there might be a bug in the current stream reader)
-- test on more input files
